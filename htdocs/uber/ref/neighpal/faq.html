<h2>About NeighPal</h2>
We have developed a system for backing the winner of any horse race.
<p>
"What? <i>Any</i> horse race?  What are you talking about?
How can you possibly know which horse is going to win in
any race?" we hear you scoff.
<p>
Ah, well we don't.  
We do not claim to know which horse is going to win, nor do
we make any predictions regarding which horse is
likely to win.
Our claim is simply that we can always back the winner of <i>any</i> race.
<p>
So, how do we achieve this?  
Simple.  We rely on the one certain piece of knowledge that we
truly do have.  
That is, that <i>one</i> horse is going to win.
Therefore, all we have to do to back the winner is to ensure
that we back <i>every</i> horse in the race.
<p>
And that's how <i>Neighpal</i> works!
<p>
Easy, innit?
